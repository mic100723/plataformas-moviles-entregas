            <h3>Season 1</h3>
            Ruby Bell, a brilliant and determined young woman, enters the opulent world of Maxton Hall on a scholarship. Her singular focus is securing a place at Oxford University, a stark contrast to the carefree extravagance of her wealthy classmates. Among them is James Beaufort, an arrogant heir, whose life revolves around privilege.
            After forgetting to submit a document for her referral letter to Mr Sutton, a teacher at the school, she stumbles upon Lydia Beaufort having a secret affair with Mr. Sutton. Lydia thinks Ruby will expose her relationship, so she resorts to her brother James for help. James attempts to buy out Ruby, who in turn refuses all of his attempts.
            Ruby then requests the school headmaster, Mr. Lexington, for the letter in place of Mr. Sutton since she no longer holds him in high regard as she did before. She informs Mr. Lexington that she is the chairman for the event organisation committee, so he makes a deal with Ruby that if she manages to pull off the upcoming event aimed to attract new potential students successfully, he would consider to write her letter.
            Mr. Sutton breaks up with Lydia even after she begs him to keep things the way they are. The party progresses smoothly until the strippers James invited to ruin Ruby's event show up, since he believes that Ruby has underlying intentions to ruin the Beaufort family with Lydia's secret.
            The headmaster is enraged and takes James off the lacrosse team and denies Ruby her letter. However, he is willing to reverse his decision if Ruby and James manage to throw a successful donor gala for the school. After the initial phase of animosity, Ruby and James begin to bond over the next few weeks with James helping out to the best of his ability.
            James prepares for the 'Young Beaufort' line, an idea that Lydia had come up with and worked hard on for years, however, their father sees Lydia unfit to lead as future CEO. Unfortunately, the press conference clashes with the gala - which James had promised Ruby that he'd attend since it was her birthday as well. After an intense conversation with his father forcing him to go to the conference, James makes a decision in the spur of the moment when rehearsing lines with Lydia in the car, and decides to go to the gala.
            James' father's wrath knows no bounds when he discovers his son's relationship with Ruby since he catches them kissing in the basement of the gala. He views her as beneath them and resorts to blackmail, threatening to destroy Ruby's future to force James to break things off. Heartbroken and desperate to protect Ruby, James makes the agonising decision to end their relationship.
            Having seen Lydia at the gala, Mr. Sutton approaches Lydia and asks her to run away with him. They agree to meet the following Thursday. However, Lydia decides to stay at a photoshoot with her family, leaving Mr. Sutton heartbroken and their escape dreams shattered. Just as they all attempt to create lives without their true loves, Lydia discovers she's pregnant with Mr. Sutton's child.
            During the Oxford colleges interview period, a 2nd year student seemingly takes a liking to Ruby. James is overcome with jealousy as he watches the two get close at a bar. Ruby publicly lashes out at him for talking down to the student at an Oxford student Q&A. They have an angry confrontation in which James comes to a realisation that he has never once done what he wanted for himself. James kisses Ruby in retaliation but Ruby asks James why he had ignored her up until then, to which he explains his dad's threats. They reconcile and have sex, Ruby nails her interviews, and James doesn't attend his final interview.
            Upon arrival back home, James and Lydia are informed that their mother has died. James becomes angry at his father for his demeanour and tackles him. Dragged off his father by his driver, James storms away, walking the streets. He finds himself in front of Ruby's house, but after seeing her happy with her family, he walks away, and the season ends.
